        <h2>
            Here you can draw what you want. <br>
            Enjoy!
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li id="explain-pixel-color">
                Each "pixel" color will be random.
            </li>
            <li id="explain-reset-grid-button">
                The button "reset-grid" will make the grid white,
                wiping every magnificent previous drawing of yours.
            </li>
            <li id="explain-set-density-button">
                The button 'Set # of "pixels"' allows you to set the amount of "pixels" 
                constituting the side of the grid (which is, believe it or not, a square).
            </li>
            <li>
                It is advised to not set # beyond 100 (since even 100 might take some time to render [10 seconds on my computer]).
            </li>
            <li>
                If you feel like a true artist being able to draw something ""realistic"" and not have the excuse "that's because it's a low resolution", set # to 100, wait for rendering (takes around 10 seconds for me) and enjoy your "ultra-hd 4kk res"!
            </li>
